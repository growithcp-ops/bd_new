1. Remove the image floating and tht description text....just keep tht tagline 
2. Change the content in India is building faster as below 
Section Heading (Left – stays bold)

INDIA IS BUILDING
FASTER THAN EVER.

Primary Narrative (Right – improved tone & articulation)

Every structure stands on materials that are rarely questioned.
For decades, construction relied on what was available—not because it was ideal, but because it was the only viable choice at scale.

Supporting Context (Bottom – smoother, grounded)

As India expands, its cities rise higher and its infrastructure stretches wider.
Homes, hospitals, institutions, and industries are being built at an unprecedented pace—reshaping landscapes faster than they can recover.

Micro Sections (History / Transition – refined & sharper)

History
The consequences weren’t immediate. They accumulated quietly—spreading far beyond their point of origin.

Transition
Development was never the problem. The absence of alternatives was. And India could not afford to slow down.

3. Change the content in Footprint refined 
**FOOTPRINT

REFINED.**

India does not need to choose between development and responsibility.
It needs systems that reduce carbon at the source—where materials are produced, moved, and reused—quietly, consistently, and at scale.

Cumulative Nature (Right Column)

Environmental impact is cumulative by nature.
What enters shared systems continues to move—through air that carries emissions, through land that absorbs extraction, and through supply chains that shape long-term carbon load.

Inset Card

SLOWING THE MOVEMENT.

When materials are produced with tighter control and lower disruption, carbon intensity begins to fall.
Not through sudden stops—but through fewer extractions, shorter transport cycles, and closed material loops.

Metric Cards (keep sharp, no fluff)

Material Usage
100%

External Waste
Zero

(Optional micro-line if you want under metrics)
Less waste outside the system means less carbon released beyond it.

4. Landing page footer is blank.....add something there 

5. make those boxes green gradient as u did in previous websites 

let me know when this is done will go ahead
